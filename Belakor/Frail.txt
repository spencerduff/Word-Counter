 	In the space of one night’s darkness
They have gathered, somehow drawn
To where sand and water meet
To the place where nature mourns

An army of one thousand souls
Moved not by force of law
But by an end of which they dreamt
Returns to wade once more

In the shallows, but a prelude
To the greatest icy depths
Where neither shape nor shadow
Can persist in one who’s stepped

Their unseeing eyes surveying 
Darkened scenes within their minds
Now blissful, soon will falter
Laying bare what now it hides

Once submerged they may awaken
Briefly grasping moonlit skies
But a crescent moon accompaniment
Merely ushers in the tide

Beneath horizons megalithic
Rays of light’s first wonder
Shall reveal an ashen shoreline strewn
With the prints of those pulled under
 	The scene where the battle took place
Now only whispers of that war remain
Through fen damp and glade deep
Crept the fog which was their bane

Harken the pain
Welcome your death and the silence it makes
As foe cleaves foe in the dawn
Bodies are strewn and sinews are torn

Blood, hate and fear are his tools
Shrouding their minds as they butcher like fools
The frenzy of panic drives their steeds
To a banquet grim for the crows to feed

Amid the fury and sickness of struggle
Ares strode unblemished and unseen
Weaving his magic and dark illusion
Upon a bloodied and wretched scene

Harken the pain
Heralding death and the silence it makes
As foe cleaves foe in the dawn
Bodies are strewn and sinews are torn

Blood, hate and fear are his tools
Shrouding their minds as they butcher like fools
The frenzy of panic drives their steeds
To a banquet grim for the crows to feed

Though Ares had drove them to fight
A madness befell those who died
To know that their cruel hand and sword
Had slain their own brethren of yore
 	At beginning of light
Where the energy gathered
Grew a sentience that was the prime
Laced with flickers of madness

As these forces drove out into dark
And the fires began to form
Each holding a mind of its own
From whence the star gods were born

The sleeping giants have awoken
Our feeble devices have broken their slumber

I begin to see
My mind grows clear
Long I lay dormant
Yet my thoughts are keen
I bathe in power
We are the Tre’aste
And I will feast upon these wretches in their ignorance

Out of the sky fire, into the darkness
We are the star gods, I will consume thee

Our imprudence
Is now all too clear
What we have stirred
Is vengeance incarnate
The fuel of the stars
Is no satiety
They will pursue us to the ends of the universe

We are but mortals, our fate is sealed

As we now accede eternity
Having stripped this plane of mortal flesh
We return once more to our dormancy
And await the renewal of life force

The Tre’aste sleep once more in the fire
Until the cycle can begin again
 	A time when the light falls clearly
A place where the struggle began
She awoke to take back her realm
And expunge the virus infecting man

A natural apostasy
Burn away the creed of frail minds

The liars sins we now embrace
Synthetic moralities will lapse
No longer to revere the feeble
Their walls of protection have collapsed

A natural apostasy
tearing down the dogma of weakness
An unnatural mentality
Will be struck from this earth

The seeds of a natural chaos will devour
The artificial values which enslave us
The wrath of the restitution will devour
the blinkered cowards who constrain us

A silence so clear
The asinine are left behind 'ere the dusk fall so near
A scene of tranquil delight
She is restored, a nuance torn
And the truth shall burn into the night
 	In charnel ceilings
Rain has formed
Held pendant over being

Ascendant night
Refracted light
The sky itself is seeing

Organic etchings
Boughd at once
Unseen opposing forces

Diurnal hymn
Has stirred within
The vast divergent courses
 	The purile form the weakened mind
The pools that linger in our wake
Compelled to act, yet not to think
These are the lambs that will surely fall

Borne out of fire, a new regime
A beacon for the ancient gods
Their empire crumbled into ash
Let ignorance reign no more

Unto the glory of the stars
We hail the night sky
Gathered beneath
We seal the pact and bring its chaos

The nothing within
Breeds darkness without
Consorting with hatred
The furious winds of belial's bond
From which there is no escape

The atrophy of mankind
Degenerated into drones
chasing illusions of any worth
To worship shadows is to live for naught

To belial the pariahs turn
To the fiends of darkness' throne
A covenant born out of the grave
Our blood shall wash away their kind

And now you see this life before thee
Is but a detour to illusion
The love they preach is but a weakness
To sate the mind-fields which they sow

As they scream into eternity
The blades of wisdom carve their flesh
A fate procured through idle minds

And now you see this life
Before thee
Is but a detour into illusion
The love that theyr preach is but a weakness
To sate the mind-fields which they sow 

As they scream into eternity
The blades of wisdom carve their flesh
A fate procured through idle minds
And nothing will remember them
