With Hearts Toward None I

Between the damned,
the pissed and the outright insane
Grand architects of failure,
sculptors of loss
No golden thrones to follow
No shrines of solace to seek

I shall erect myself over transience
I shall ascend over flesh
Steadfastly tearing through aether
I shall rise to the beyond
I shall reveal heights
not yet imagined
I shall rewrite Summa de homine
I shall speak with tongues of angels
And I shall burn with pure light

I will burn allright

On to rupture; bonds rearranged
Scorch the archaic remnants
and rip through primordial thoughts
On to diremption: self / kin
All glory and strenght of culture
now null and void

No golden thrones to follow
No shrines of solace to be found
And only the locusts shall sing
at the end of the day


With Hearts Toward None II

Repent! Repent!
For the LORD has risen
high and proud
His chariot drawn
by rats and vultures
And adorned
with heads of skeptics

Yes!
The LORD is on the prowl tonight
The LORD will be diligent
For there are many to be smitten
and the LORD loves holocausts

The hand of the LORD
is eager to bestow
Yes, The LORD
will bestow his grace
Until you pray for the fall

He shall distress the weary
He shall disgrace the meek
He shall rip out the eyes of the lame
And he shall cripple the blind

Repent! Praise! Repent!
Praise the LORD of hosts,
of bestial and human filth,
of blistering gangrene
and crawilng carnage,
of death piled upon death,
the great sower descends
to reap the crops.


With Hearts Toward None III

Threshold wanderers
Daath dwellers
Usucaptors in lands
of no hope and no grace

Preachers of the fall
Surveyors of the astray
In darkness and in ruin,
in gutters of ascension
Behold the Logos
begotten of death

From the midst of cold ash
comes the voice of the living god
Further down
to the roots of withered pillars
Through the scorched ground
And you shall know perdition
And it will set you free

Grey ash prayer
Severed from the unconscious
Perverse theodicy
Atrocious immanence

With hearts toward none


With Hearts Toward None IV

All hail reapers of hope
All hail the seer of confusion
To grind the sandstones of culture
And to reveal the true foundation
of terror and fevers

Under vigilant eyes
of watchdogs of psyche
Let loose by loving brethren
Jaws dripping with balm
of righteous comfort
To pour upon conflict,
Turmoil and friction

Now bite into the essence
and cut into fabric of life
Unearth the fragile construct
below instilled order

Never surrender
Never retreat
In this the weapons
are our very lives
Fuck hope and godspeed


With Hearts Toward None V

Behold the high order abstractors
Anthropologists
and engineers alike
The virtuous, the chaste
Weaving new layers of oblivion

Behold the kings
and leaders of men
Warlords of retreat,
sovereigns of surrender
The righteous, the pure
Now gathered upon the new form

A monument is risen
To be seen from afar
Erected by thieves
Financed by murderers
And secured by lawyers

Fear upon fear
Inbuilt braces
Scripted obedience

Behold trangression,
conform and gorge
Bask in the radiance
of purified norm
There will be no distress,
no more trembling
The muzzle never felt that good


With Hearts Toward None VI

I call upon the name
of purificating angel,
Upon the name of strangling angel
Let the world drink again
fromthe fountains of the great deep
Let majestic springs erupt
upon the footsteps of men
Let the skies dim with clouds
of heavenly splendour
Let the waters of redemption arise
Let the children drink freely
from these rivers of grace
And let there come the rain,
let there come the rain

And may it wash away the scum,
the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit,
the whores, the junk, the trash, the
worms, the freaks, the rot, the
plague, the grime, the smut, the
waste, the pigs, the slime, the mud,
the vermin of every shape and size

Higher, higher
Hoist the banners of shame

I call upon the great day
of disgust and scorn,
where man and beast
are turned to clay
Where all flesh dies
that moves upon the earth
And this rotten cesspool
is swept all clean


With Hearts Toward None VII

Have ye courage, o my brethren?
The signs are everywhere.
Some did not see it coming,
others refused to see.
I can feel it in the tingle of the air,
in the heartbeat of the earth
And I can tell that the storm is
coming all down on me.

Come redemption
As the litany of abandonment
rings through ruined temples
As the darkest night of them all
falls upon the scorched
home shores
As the great fervour within
is crawling in stasis and dirt

Earthbound,
yet striving to walk upon the wind
Always downwards - and toward
the farthest sides of the north

There come
the agents of change,
stiff and inert
Pillars of reason
and pillars of belief,
In the footsteps
of their fathers' virtues
Always downwards - and toward
the farthest sides of the north
There is the nadir
There comes the storm
