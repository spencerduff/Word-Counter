Kel Valhaal

Kel Valhaal lives in a constellation of gears divided
Partitioned eternally by horizons
The absolute the undifferentiated
Which has no divisions
no time no extension

Kel Valhaal lives in a constellation of gears divided
Partitioned eternally by horizons
The absolute the undifferentiated
Which has no divisions
no time no extension

Plain colloquy
Aesthetic emergency
Glowing like halogen
Bottle of oxygen
Ideas like meteors
Crush thermometers
Vascular furniture
Saying oracular
You're too good for her
Chains stability
Insensitivity
Cluttered infinity
Bombshells over the cities
Attention to detail
Projectile
Of the messianic astonishment at the prosaic
Turned away from the project established by Muriel and Jain
Pain is the product of pain and the definition of evolution 
Because repetition isn't revolutionary

Kel Valhaal lives in a constellation of gears divided
Partitioned eternally by horizons
The absolute the undifferentiated
Which has no divisions

The bloody ritual 
Brooding individual
Buy up residuals

The doors of perception will open and close
Hope will exist in a problematic relationship with reason
Libidinal energy will whirl round like a rattle rattling
Hearts will be stopped bones will shatter shattering
Spreading out rhizomatic
Stuttering automatic
Pulling meaning from the void
Hoping to gradually fill the glass
Unemployment
A helmet of tinsel a saber of wax
A pole vault of side cues
Mountaintops ice picks
Computer chips silicone
Webcam not alone
Roulette studio
Intrude video
Ligaments of time tie nothing
History books frisky girls
Curling up officers
Uppercuts
Golden locks framing blue eye
Pert lips
Heart blossom

Eternal principle
Inverted pentacle
Innocently seminal

Tearing the abdomen deep within the harlequin
Put on the summer masque, someday could start again

The breasts are getting full
The robe is coming down
Consummation of the rules

The swinging pendulum
Missing emotions 
Trying to find them
The tangle behind them

Enormous pinnacle
Slumbering virgin
Orbiting station

Reddening visage

Reign Array

I killed the air
Surrounding the vines

I sold the will
For ten pages of lies

I broke the hive
Pink infants stomped around

I rode the lane
To the program of light

Lay aside the elegant prayers of the fragile
Altercation with another bride
Tape along the conical zone of the golden
Coronation of the enterprise 

Take the brand from parrying hands of the victor
Re-ignition of a better place
With a flame made up of manifold pains in the shoulders
Of the bronzed giants of yesterday 

Reign along the celebration of the
Days of reconciliation with the 
Brave whose epic tribulation in the cage
Undid the contribution to the pain

New celebration 
Reign Array
Metastasization of the way

Recirculation of all the things you know
Uncovered lingam in the snow

Reign Array

Recirculation of all the things you know
Uncovered lingam in the snow


Vitriol

Because soon the flowers will close up and sleep peacefully
Because soon the ADHD kids will quiet down respectfully
Because soon the tractors will drive themselves on orderly hills
Because soon the pineal eye the pineal eye a penny a lie selah selah

I turn your ashes to gold
You repay me with vitriol
I allow your eyelashes to grow
You repay me with vitriol
I induce your honor sash to glow
You repay me with vitriol
Vitriol

Soon the yellow teeth will be fresh breath white
Soon money will be paper and success will be a crime
Soon the same jacket will fit every shoulder
Soon all the guys get into art school
Soon the cats will sing to their litter
Soon the trumpets will all melt together
Soon all the alloys will be separated
Soon jehova will part the waters
Soon the delicacies will be sprinkled with sea salt
Soon the media will try to be honest
Soon religions will love one another
Shoulder to shoulder
Primordial gender no more
Li and chi will kiss one another soon
Yin and Yang collapse together soon
Embryo

Soon form an content will cleave to one another
Soon thought will spurt out into expression
Soon contraception will conquer the earth
Soon cherubim give birth to single parents
Soon gauze will cover the caskets
Soon I'll rule this anthill at last
Soon I'll run this racket at last
Soon the reason to go on living will be obvious
Soon the future will glitter with promise
Soon the range will be roved by wild horse
Free spirits
Assertive but respectful
Comfortable but not bored
Soon creation will finish its process
Soon all struggles will be recreational
And it will be time to arrive at a higher beginning
And let some other sufferer take it from here
Take it from here from here from here

Because soon the flowers will close up and sleep peacefully
Because soon the ADHD kids will quiet down respectfully
Because soon the tractors will drive themselves on orderly hills
Because soon the pineal eye the pineal ey a penny a lie selah selah

I turn your ashes to gold
You repay me with vitriol
I allow your eyelashes to grow
You repay me with vitriol
I induce your honor sash to glow
You repay me with vitriol

Soldered wives

Golden thread

Droning crowd
Furrowed brow
Wage a total war
Pull your purple heart

Fragile stem
From a girl
