Baptized in Black Goat Blood

Baptised in black goat blood on the mystic altar
Infernal gods of death bless thy sons of Satan

Raise the knife; cut the goat, drain its blood
and fill the chalice

Ancient words are spoken as the rite begins
Members of the cult raise their torches high

Raise the knife; cut the goat, drain its blood
and fill the chalice

The moon is full... the night is cold...the stars are bright...the wind so moans...A fire burns...within our forest...the blood is thick...and only black

Baptised in black goat blood on the mystic altar
Infernal gods of death bless thy sons of Satan


Crush the Jewish Prophet

We are the warriors of Satan's legion
We are the soldiers of infernal war
Knife in my hand, axe in the other
We are the killers in search of Christ

Crush, Crush, Crush... Jesus
Crush, Crush, Crush... Jesus

Prepare for battle weak lambs of God
Lord of destruction I summon thee
Grant us your powers of annihilation
Crush the Jewish prophet, death to Christian faith

Crush, Crush, Crush... Jesus
Crush, Crush, Crush... Jesus


Under the Black Inverted Pentagram

Satan, dark lord I sing to thee
With pride I stand under your sign

Ancient mystic symbol of truth
Cast your unholy dark spells to me

Cryptic goat horns within...black stars
Red eyes looking inside...black stars
Moon rays shining upon...black stars
Chanting dark hymns under...black stars


Of Blood and Darkness We Are Born

Members of the cult 
Circle of the elite 
Raise your head high 
Whit satanic pride 

Fire burns in our name, sons of darkness, brotherhood 
Of Satan 
As the wolves in the forest we shall walk together 
In shadows 

Left hand path to hell guide us far where wisdom lays 
We seek truth and knowledge, grant us this and we 
Shall honor 

We are born from blood 
We are born from darkness 
We are strongest as strong 
We are Satan’s sons 

Members of the cult 
Circle of the elite 
Raise your head high 
Whit satanic pride 

Chants of pagan sons rise to the heavens that cry 
Sounds of ancient hymns fly across the forest whit pride 
War drums shake the earth and summon our heathen gods 
Old horns bray whit might and awake all who that sleep


Dark Mutilation Rites

Unholy rites of blood and knives
Sell inflicted wounds for my lord of Hell

Altar calls my name; I shall summon my own death
Take my offer to you king of all kings

Far inside our temple black candles burn
Six inverted crosses hang on the walls

Mutilation now begins as the ancient cult chants
I cut my flesh in the name of Satan

Cut, cut, so deeply cut, drain your life for me
High above the cosmic sky, thrones of black await
Far below the black soiled earth, thrones of fire await
Cut, cut, so deeply cut, give your soul to me


Magnificent Glorification of Lucifer

Wisdom of darkness lies in the shadows
Mystical fire burns on your black torch
Star in the night sky, brightest of all stars
Son of the morning shining unholy

Fallen from heaven rebel of angels
You are my ruler, lead me to your throne
Speak to me master, teach me your secrets
Follow the left hand path into Hell's fire

Chanting to my lord as he looks at me
I obey his words in return for strenght
To Him I remain loyal to the cult
Hail Lucifer... Hail Lucifer


Impaled by the Cryptic Horns of Baphomet

Cryptic horns pierce the flesh like a spear brings your death
Baphomet raise your horns, pierce the heavens, make them bleed...

Blow you fire, burn the angels, summon soldiers to your order
Baphomet raise your horns, pierce the lambs, make them bleed...


We Summon the Winds of Fire (For the Burning of All Holiness)

Burning fire
From the depths of Hell
Your powers I invoke
With these words I chant...

Winds of fire; burn flames of Satan's realm
Destroy holy skies for the end of light

Open gates of Hell
I call upon your forces
Release your fire gods
Burn with pride the holy throne...

Winds of fire; flames of Satan's realm
Destroy holy skies for the end of light

Holy throne in ashes
Unholy throne supreme
Victory is in the fire
Fire is in our hands...


Eternal Loyalty to Our Lord Satan

Lord of eternal might I sing to thee
I raise my torch and worship thee
King of all kings I swear to thee
Forever I shall be loyal to thee
I bow before thee
You are my fire
These words go to you
Hail one of truth

Fire burns!
Loyal I shall be...
