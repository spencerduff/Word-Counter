Ancient Monumental War Hymn

Satan I invoke
Lucifer I call
Berith one of war
Hymns of battle roar!

Flesh of Christians rip
Blood of feeble drip
Bones are burnt to ash
All in name of Satan

Realm of Christ will fall
Underworld shall rise
Reign upon the light
Ancient rite of war...

Beast of fire speaks
Hell\'s gates open wide
Death of holy sons
Sacred graves open


Nocturnal Gatherings and Wicked Rites

I am the one that is summoning thee through the powers and the forces of Satan
I am the one that is calling for rites for the gathering of holy burnings
Dark moon in the blackest skies I call upon your presence for wisdom
All in a circle of wicked rites, blood of the virgin shall drip tonight

Starlight from the cosmic sea shines upon the blood soaked altar
Unholy fire that burns up high on the head of the ancient horned goat king
Pleasure of the sacrifice brings us might, strength of a beast we are given
All in a circle of wicked rites, blood of the virgin shall drip tonight

Lord in the heavens we deny, followers of you we despise
We are the ones born of fire, element of earth you must fear
Now is the time to worship death through the sacrifice of the holy bitch
All in a circle of wicked rites, blood of the virgin shall drip tonight


Strike of the Morning Star

Come to the cryptic tombs, hear their call
Fire rises up high from the mouth of Hell
Strong as iron and steel I attack with hate
Dark legions in service of Satan strike with lethal fate

Destroy sons of Christ - Attack sons of Christ

Rise of the sharpest blade, prepare for war
Lords of the Heathen ones grant us might
With pride we stand up strong, claim our ways
Strike of the morning star obliterates

Destroy sons of Christ - Attack sons of Christ

Exterminate them, annihilate them, exterminate them, annihilate them

Destroy sons of Christ - Attack sons of Christ

March to the sounds of war soldiers of Satan
March to the sounds of lightning sons of Thor
Power of fire and ice inverts the cross
Blood runs down the hills from synagogues

Destroy sons of Christ - Attack sons of Christ


Through the Infinite Sphere Our Majesty Shall Rise

Through the cosmos demons fly as a dark star killing light
Universe without an end opens gates that lead beyond
Oh! death take me now, may my soul become of dust

Majesty as old as time when beginning was the end...
Master of the ancient war where the angels fall below
Darkness of unholy kingdom - shadows of Lord Satan\'s throne

We of fire, wind and moon call to you
I am summoned to your realm where you rise as Lord of Hell

Chanting winds of burning skies moan forever
High upon spheres of glass our majesty shall rise again


Infernal Evocation of Torment

Beneath the battlefields burns the fire of the ancients
I call upon the demons Abbadon, Berith and Satan

As the blaze of the ancient cult burns the enemy with hatred
\"Holy trinity of God I trample on your faces\"

Cryptic tombs in the earth open for the lambs of Jesus
Morning star in the sky... shine upon the earth your forces
Big as a moon, bright as a star, strong like the wind I kill you
To you I bring this ritual - Infernal Evocation Of Torment

As the blaze of the ancient cult burns the enemy with hatred
\"Holy trinity of God I trample on your faces\"

Dark flames of the blackest thrones illuminate the skies of a crescent moon
Like the sea with titanic waves enemies of God will sink you


Where Darkness Is Lord and Death the Beginning

Melancholy moan of mystic wind
Melodies of sadness that sing the hymn
Towers casting shadows over graves of loan
Fire on the torches now dies with gloom
Walking on a path of lonesome doom
Silence of a night when death arrives
Travel through the tunnel when life shall end...
Never finding light at the end.

Symphony plays... music of the dead and darkness sings
Funeral chants... wicked lord of song and words of sorrow
Pagans dance... holding black torches as a symbol of death
Lonesome tomb... summons me to eternal realms


Nefarious Dismal Orations

Master Satan, king of Inferno
Whisper to me spells that annihilate

Black goat urine fills a human skull
Menstrual black blood drips on the altar

Candles of black made from human fat
Infants crucified, throats cut, skin peeled

Nefarious dismal orations... magical words of the elite
Nefarious dismal orations... gather, stand and hail
Nefarious dismal orations... the sound of Satan\'s cult
Ancient rites of passage as the members sing
Black nocturnal skies embrace the full moon light
Now I sing to masters that obey my call... await!


Enter the Cult

Before the Symbol of Satan We Bow and Praise

Praise the symbol of Satan\'s might, bow before the darkest light
Hold the torch and chant with pride, as the bells chime tonight we rise

Dancing in shadows, casting dark spells where the holy ones hide
Mystical fire, shining on the altar of the ancient king
Enter the cult, follow the ways of the left hand path
Trample on the cross, praise the pentagram and all Hail Satan

Bray the horns of shining bronze, songs for rites on full moon nights
Far in lonesome woodland realms stands the temple of the cult

Dancing in shadows, casting dark spells where the holy ones hide
Mystical fire, shining on the altar of the ancient king
Enter the cult, follow the ways of the left hand path
Trample on the cross, praise the pentagram and all Hail Satan

On the darkest mountain peaks where the black winds carry me...
There I stand and sing this hymn to the sounds of infernal bells
