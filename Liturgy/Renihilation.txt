Pagan Dawn

A cascade of lightning startles the firmament
A thousand black hooves clatter
Upon the mountain

Grey plume of dust
Red flag of blood
Blue shining blade of sky

Spark with no cause
Wound with no sword

Fresh skulls and supple bones
Golden helm of radiance

The incantation uttered by no one
The call to arms from nowhere

The message from the clarion
Resounded across deaf hills
Men awoke
And sprayed their blood upon the earth

Spark with no cause
Wound with no sword
Unseeing eye
Blood mixed with blood


Mysterium

O sail of skin tumbling in the air
Blowing anywhere

O absent law
Chattering useless teeth
Secreting quiet sweat

Mysterium
Mysterium
Mysterium

O mirror that does not reflect

O fire that illuminates nothing
But itself

O shadow of what never was
But seems to have been
And to have been lost

Mysterium
Mysterium
Mysterium

Ecstatic Rite

And the yoke weighed heavily
Upon the neck
And the tractors placed their tracks
Upon the cowering soil

The arrow cast
The bow pulled back
The arrow cast

And the chains were linked to other chains
Forged obliquely, freeing no one and everyone

Ecstatic rite
Divide the father

Ecstatic rite
Divide the father

From river to sea
The waves sing and shine
Untrained, unrestrained
Desiring nothing
From hill to vale
Form gives way to form


Arctica

The steam shall give birth to a glacier
The heath shall give way to sand
Bone shall become tusk
Hair shall become nail
Tooth shall cling to skull

Being shall become
The eternal return
Of fire

Asphault shall flow like water
Forest shall crowd out the worms

Nothing ever began
There was no dawn
The heat chars
The cold stabs

The wheat shall give way to chaff
Bone shall crack against bone

Being shall become
The eternal return
Of fire

Beyond the Magic Forest

False horizon
Pointing nowhere
The sky is not blue
The air is not crisp

Brother, sister
Tear through the forest

Brother, sister
Tear through the forest

The sun doesn't set
Its bronze rays do not
Sparkle in the water
They do not brush against my lashes
As I stare
Like a statue

Behind the Void

In vain the iron-wrought tower
Pierces heaven's dome
In vain the muscle tears it's fiber
Ten more fibers blossom in its place

They tried to plant a flag
Behind the void

In vain the moat surrounds the castle
Mud skulks across its bed
In vain contraction
In vain expansion

In vain our kind seeks total order
There is a fissure at the heart of being

They tried to plant a flag
Behind the void


Renihilation

I force through the opening
I claw through veil after veil

Absent purity
Painted dawn

Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation

I choke the apocalyptic trumpet
With my power
Resounding though the arcangel
Like marrow

Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation

Absent purity
Painted dawn
The future is nowhere
The past is gone

Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
