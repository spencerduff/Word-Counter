High Gold

High gold
Holy noon
Ribbons of gas
Flailing across the Sun

Boil the anchors
Scatters the spangles
Lift up the limp red tongs

Scald the glowing gauntlets
And molten coin
Eradicate the shadows
Ignite the wool

High gold
Holy noon
Ribbons of gas
Flailing across the Sun


True Will

Floating upwards
Lungs filling up with air
As God inhales me
Into the impossible
I wave a sad goodbye
To each newly conquered territory

Nomad hearth
Consuming its own home
The glow of warm joy
Leaving dry form
Carcass Ashes

True will

Green life scraped from copper vaults
Silver pins in crippled cartilage
Ballooning substrate of eternity
Without reason's diamond
Without imagination

True will
Inhalation
Magnet charger
Lightning Blaze
Everything that ever was
Slightly changes

Green life scraped from copper vaults
Silver pins in crippled cartilage
Ballooning substrate of eternity
Without reason's diamond


Returner	

Returner
Bursting Universal
Violation of the law

Renamer
God destroyer of a God

Returner
Violation of the law
Plant toxic bombs in marble tombs

Redeemer
Stream the universal us
Through optical ISP transmission lines
Crack my fathers' spines
And sail me to Chimera

Lay down a long leg
And elegant toe
And let me buckle your sandal


Generation


Tragic Laurel

The hero's statue drips with stones
Parched dried up like his bones

The tragic laurel goes
To the temples
As their doors come to a close

The lava blows
Vesuvius Blushes
Underneath his clothes

The tragic laurel goes
With the torso
Locked in contrappasto pose

The tragic laurel goes
The tragic laurel goes
The tragic laurel goes


Sun of Light

Good genius
Offering itself in flickers
Everywhere fragile flashes
Wormholes into an unconceived future

Sun of Sun of Sun
Sun of Sun of Sun

Beads of acid
Bedfeathers flying
Through dried up gashes of air

Indices of the moment
When nature's necklace was clipped
And her pearls sprayed everywhere

Sun of Sun of Sun


Helix Skull


Glory Bronze

Gashed shoulders and crippled loins
Huge steampunk boulders
Nestling between cargo khaki knees
Magenta flush across your cheek

Eyes on the horizon
On the oasis siren
On pairs of Tits

Helicopter of vultures
Tornado senselessly a'whirl

You diagonalize
You tear the continents apart
And plunge into the gulf
And flush your eyes with crime
And hoard up all the rubles

Glory Bronze
Glory Bronze
Along

As the blood of God
Bursts the veins of time
Give your avatar a kiss
An abyss spits out another abyss


Veins of God


Red Crown

Rub the red crown
Tie the knot of veins

Red crown
White collar
Golden tooth
Hang the chandelier of bones

Rub the red crown
Wear a purple robe of meat

A sparrow flits his feather
Like a chain of bubbles
Soaking in heat
Fucking in an orgy
Of primordial undecidability

From chaos to the brain

I am an army of pulses
My hard skin is a flute
My brawn is a catapult

Rub the red crown
TIe the knot of veins
Rub the red crown
Hang the chandelier of bones


Glass Earth

Hey


Harmonia

Hurry weave me an old crystal web
Spheres of glass fight with axes of lead
Orbs of eyes hands of fathers of eggs
Hearts of shitwire hangers of heads
Chase of fortunes chafing red thighs
Caustic scales female justice averred

Hum together O little angels
Little bees crying in mirrors of wax
Hum together sections of agriculture
Hum together battlers of valor

Twang together frothing with reveined eyes
Glossolaliac little Jews harps
Wagging tongues dance with throats of raw ululation
Drip from jowls ye hot drops of prey

Harmonia
Hum O bothered web

Pull the hinges out from under your door frames
Puff an honest cough from your chest
Bend gymnastic O supple children
Shear the wool from your innocent flesh

Harmonia
Throb with sex O heartless web

Hurry weave me an old crystal web
Spheres of glass fight with axes of lead
Orbs of eyes hands of fathers of eggs
Hearts of shitwire hangers of heads
Chase of fortune chafing red thighs
Mounted hips wrinkled old drippy eyes
